React-Basics:
Ques-1: What us Reactjs?
Ans: ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) and single-page applications.
It was developed and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers. React is one of the 
most popular and widely used libraries for building front-end web applications.
The main goal of React is to enable developers to build reusable, component-based UI components that can 
efficiently update and render data as the application state changes. React uses a declarative and 
component-based approach, which means developers can describe how the UI should look based on the current state, 
and React will take care of updating the DOM efficiently.

==> Key features of ReactJS include:

Components: React breaks the UI into small, reusable, and self-contained components. Each component manages its 
state and lifecycle, which makes it easier to build and maintain complex UIs.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to efficiently update only the necessary parts of 
the actual DOM. This approach reduces the number of costly DOM operations, resulting in improved performance.

JSX (JavaScript XML): React allows developers to write UI components using JSX, which is a syntax extension that
enables HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code. JSX makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Unidirectional Data Flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data flows from parent components to 
child components. This ensures predictable state management and easier debugging.

React Hooks: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks are functions that allow developers to use state and other React 
features without writing a class. Hooks simplify the code and promote reuse of stateful logic.

Rich Ecosystem: React has a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries, tools, and extensions that make it even 
more powerful for various use cases.



Ques-2: why we use reactjs?
Ans: ReactJS is used for several reasons, and its popularity stems from the advantages it offers to developers 
and the overall development process. Here are some key reasons why ReactJS is widely used:

Component-Based Architecture: React promotes a modular and component-based approach to building user interfaces.
Each component is self-contained, making it easy to manage and reuse code. This component-based architecture 
helps in creating more maintainable and scalable applications.

Declarative Syntax: React uses a declarative approach, where developers describe how the UI should look based 
on the current state, rather than imperatively defining the DOM manipulation. This makes the code more readable 
and easier to understand.

Virtual DOM and Efficient Rendering: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM (Virtual DOM) that allows 
it to efficiently update only the necessary parts of the actual DOM when the application state changes. 
This approach reduces costly DOM operations and improves application performance.

One-Way Data Binding: React follows a unidirectional data flow, where data flows from parent components to 
child components. This makes it easier to track changes and understand the application state, leading to more predictable behavior.

React Hooks: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow developers to use state and other React features without writing class components. 
Hooks make it easier to reuse stateful logic and simplify the code.

Large and Active Community: React has a massive and active community of developers, which means there is a wealth of resources, libraries, 
and tools available to support React-based projects.

React Native: React can be used to build not only web applications but also mobile applications through React Native. With React Native, 
developers can use the same codebase to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms.

Performance Optimization: React's efficient rendering process and Virtual DOM help optimize application performance. Additionally, React's 
ability to handle rendering on the server-side (Server-Side Rendering - SSR) can improve initial load times and SEO.

Great Developer Tools: React comes with excellent developer tools like React DevTools, which facilitate debugging, inspecting component 
hierarchies, and monitoring performance.

Easy Integration: React can be easily integrated into existing applications. It works well with other libraries and frameworks, and it is not 
opinionated about the rest of the technology stack.

Backed by Facebook: React is developed and maintained by Facebook, which provides stability, regular updates, and long-term support to the 
library.



Ques-3: What is State and Event?
State:
"State" refers to the current condition or data of a component or application at a specific moment in time. In ReactJS, components can have 
state, which represents the data that can change over time and influences how the component renders and behaves. State allows components to 
dynamically update and re-render based on user interactions, data changes, or other triggers.
Events:
"Events" are actions or occurrences that happen in the user interface, such as clicking a button, typing in an input field, or scrolling. 
In React, you can handle events using event handlers, which are functions that respond to specific events and execute some code in response.
